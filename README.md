# .NETPortfolio
Repository containing small, feature/framework oriented projects, created in order to practice and showcase knowledge regarding particular subject.

Please note that in these projects you can find some code that is not following best practices, like taking shortcuts for configuration etc. Most of the time I've tried to follow best practices in order to make quality code, however these projects are created for showcase examples for a particular subject and that required compromises in some cases.
Thanks to that the projects are not over engineered, and can be focused on the subject in question.
